## 🚨 Critical Issues (Severity: HIGH)

### 1. JSON Syntax Errors - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Issue**: 9 lab files contain JSON syntax errors preventing proper parsing

**Impact**: 
- Platform functionality compromised
- Labs cannot be loaded or processed
- User experience severely impacted

**Affected Files**:
1. `enterprise-governance-lab.json` - Missing comma delimiter (line 93)
2. `identity-access-lab.json` - Missing property quotes (line 100)
3. `advanced-networking-patterns-lab.json` - Missing property quotes (line 84)
4. `hub-spoke-architecture-lab.json` - Missing property quotes (line 74)
5. `well-architected-framework-lab.json` - Missing comma delimiter (line 144)
6. `monitoring-logging-lab.json` - Missing comma delimiter (line 105)
7. `multi-account-governance-lab.json` - Missing comma delimiter (line 540)
8. `high-performance-computing-lab.json` - Missing property quotes (line 100)
9. `azure-landing-zones-lab.json` - Missing comma delimiter (line 84)

**Recommendation**: **CRITICAL** - Fix all JSON syntax errors immediately before any production deployment.

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 2. Field Naming Inconsistency

**Issue**: Mixed camelCase and snake_case field naming conventions

**Details**:
- Time fields: `estimatedTime` (42 files) vs `estimated_time` (56 files)
- Service fields: `awsServices`/`azureServices` vs `aws_services`/`azure_services`

**Impact**: 
- Code maintenance complexity
- Potential parsing issues
- Developer confusion

**Recommendation**: Standardize on camelCase for consistency with certification labs

### 3. Structural Variation

**Issue**: 3 different lab structure patterns identified

**Details**:
- **Pattern 1** (56 files): Full certification structure with `awsCertification`, `certificationWeight`
- **Pattern 2** (31 files): Basic lab structure with `aws_services`, `azure_services`
- **Pattern 3** (11 files): Legacy structure with minimal metadata

**Impact**: Moderate - creates complexity in processing and validation

**Recommendation**: Migrate all labs to Pattern 1 for full certification alignment
